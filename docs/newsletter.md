Also:

- we are trying to attract contributors. We need pull request (PR) reviewers;
  - easy task to do:
    - if you find something: good;
    - if not: we'll find out later.
  - see [issue/#186](https://github.com/openwall/john-packages/issues/186).
- we stopped merging unreviewed (non-essential) commits;
  - if a commit is not essential for maintaining the repository, it will wait for a reviewer.
  - pull requests related to this rule/criteria are labeled 'help wanted'.
